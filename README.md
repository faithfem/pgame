Welcome to your Node.js project on Cloud9 IDE!

This chat example showcases how to use `socket.io` with a static `express` server.

## Running the server

1) Open `server.js` and start the app by clicking on the "Run" button in the top menu.

2) Alternatively you can launch the app from the Terminal:

    $ node server.js

Once the server is running, open the project in the shape of 'https://projectname-username.c9users.io/'. As you enter your name, watch the Users list (on the left) update. Once you press Enter or Send, the message is shared with all connected clients.

/* GAME RULES:
-The game has 2 players, playing in turns.
-At each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he wishes. Each result gets added to his ROUND score.
-But if the player rolls a 1, his ROUND score resets to zero and it's the next player's turn to roll.
-A player can choose to HOLD which means his ROUND score gets added to his GLOBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn.
-The first player to reach 100 points on the GLOBAL score wins.*/
